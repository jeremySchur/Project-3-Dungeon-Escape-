ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is implementing a text-based adventure game in C++. The game takes inspiration from Dungeons and Dragons.
The story is made up by the user and each playing experience is different due to randomization of features in the game. The 
game allows the user to play with a party of players / compnaions that also interact with the game. Users will fight monsters,
solve puzzles, and interact with NPCs.
